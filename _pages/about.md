I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University (Espoo, Finland), and I am affiliated with the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI). I am part of the [Cyber-Physical Systems group](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-automation/cyber-physical-systems), lead by [Prof. Dominik Baumann](https://baumanndominik.github.io/). Just before starting this position, I was a postdoctoral researcher at IMT Nord Europe (Lille, France) and a visiting researcher at the University of Edinburgh, working mainly with [Prof. Víctor Elvira](https://victorelvira.github.io/). I finished the Ph.D. in Multimedia and Communications (Statistical Signal Processing) from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in 2022, under the supervision of [Prof. Joaquí­n Mí­guez](https://jmiguez.webs.tsc.uc3m.es/).

My **research interests** are focused on computational statistics, data assimilation, and signal processing. More specifically, I am interested in Bayesian inference in state-space models as well as in Bayesian experimental design. I work on providing new techniques that run recursively (online) with reduced computational complexity (compared to the state-of-the-art methods) to obtain both parameter and state estimates. I'm also interested in the application of these probabilistic methods in different fields of science such as ecology, energy, geoscience, and climate.

## News

- **July 2025**: Excited to visit the Illinois Institute of Technology (Chicago, USA) to give a talk in the special session on *Nested expectations: models and estimators* at [MCM 2025](https://fjhickernell.github.io/mcm2025/). [(slides)](http://sarapv.github.io/files/slides/2025_MCM.pdf)
- **July 2025**: Happy to be back at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, where I gave an invited talk at the [GTS Seminar](https://gts.tsc.uc3m.es/gts-seminars/) and served as committee member for the PhD defense of [José Alberto Martínez-Ordóñez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-alberto-martinez-ordo%C3%B1ez-341607114/). His thesis *Discrete-time nonlinear Markov switching models: stability, inference and physical applications* was a pleasure to read :)
- **June 2025**: Great to return to Vigo (Spain), where I studied my bachelor’s, to attend and serve as a poster session chair at the [SIC workshop 2025](https://comonsens.webs.tsc.uc3m.es/comonsens-2/sic25/) (Universidade de Vigo).
- **June 2025**: First visit to the University of Cambridge, inspired by the workshop [Accelerating statistical inference and experimental design with machine learning](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/rclw03/) in the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences.
