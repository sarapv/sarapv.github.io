I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University (Espoo, Finland), and I am affiliated with the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI). I am part of the [Cyber-Physical Systems group](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-automation/cyber-physical-systems), lead by [Prof. Dominik Baumann](https://baumanndominik.github.io/). Just before starting this position, I was a postdoctoral researcher at IMT Nord Europe (Lille, France) and a visiting researcher at the University of Edinburgh, working mainly with [Prof. Víctor Elvira](https://victorelvira.github.io/). I finished the Ph.D. in Multimedia and Communications (Statistical Signal Processing) from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in 2022, under the supervision of [Prof. Joaquí­n Mí­guez](https://jmiguez.webs.tsc.uc3m.es/).

<!-- My **research interests** are focused on computational statistics, data assimilation, and signal processing. More specifically, I am interested in Bayesian inference in state-space models as well as in Bayesian experimental design. I work on providing new techniques that run recursively (online) with reduced computational complexity (compared to the state-of-the-art methods) to obtain both parameter and state estimates. I'm also interested in the application of these probabilistic methods in different fields of science such as ecology, energy, geoscience, and climate. -->

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of Bayesian inference, experimental design, and machine learning. I develop probabilistic methods that make data acquisition and decision-making more efficient, reliable, and adaptive. Much of my work focuses on **Bayesian experimental design (BED)** and its extension to **continual**, **non-stationary**, and **non-ergodic** environments — settings where systems evolve over time and classical assumptions break down. I also work on scalable methods for **online Bayesian inference** and **sequential Monte Carlo**, enabling learning and inference in complex dynamical systems.

This research connects fundamental statistical methodology with practical challenges in areas such as AI for science, control, and robotics, and has strong links to probabilistic machine learning, reinforcement learning, and adaptive decision-making.
